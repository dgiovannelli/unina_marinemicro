Introductory class in Marine Microbial Diversity for graduate students pursuing a Master Degree in Marine Biology and Aquaculture. The class gives a recap of basic microbiology and microbial ecology concepts and then jumps into a more in depth analysis of the major microbial groups and marine ecosystems. The course is designed to provide general background in marine microbiology to non-specialist coming from diverse subjects (Biology, Biotechnology, Natural Sciences, Environmental Sciences). Originally the class included a group exercise to write a Wikipedia article on the subject. You see the results of the Wikipedia writing assignment on our [Wikipedia course page](https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/campaigns/microbiology_teaching_in_italy/programs).

In the repository you'll find the different version of the class relative to each academic year. I always try to improve the class material year on year, so I suggest if interested to use the latest available year.
